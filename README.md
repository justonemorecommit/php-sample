### `app`

The app directory contains the core code of your application. Each app package can contain controllers, models, views and services.

### `bootstrap`

The `bootstrap` directory contains the `bootstrap.php` file which bootstraps the app.

### `cache`

The cache directory contains compiled twig templates.

### `database`

The database directory contains your database migrations.

### `public`

The public directory contains the index.php file, which is the entry point for all requests entering the application and configures auto loading. This directory also houses app assets such as images, JavaScript, and CSS.
